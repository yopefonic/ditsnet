                                        <p>Hi, If you didn't notice it yet... My name is Joost Elfering and I'm a Dutch web-designer/developer. I was born in 1985. The year of Ms Windows 1.0, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifest</a>, foundation of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> and the movie "Back to the future".</p>
                                        <p>I was born into a new technological world on the move. The technology grew, so did I.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="cube s2x1">
                                        <p>Technology has always been something central in my life. At the age of five I had my first contact with a computer and at seven we got our first home computer in the family.</p>
                                        <p>Other technology like tv's, audio installations and other gadgets always interested me. I like to be an ealy adopter and tinker with new toys.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="cube s1x1">
                                        <p>Technology is only part of what I do. Design is also part of my heritage. My family has an artistic history of painters, sculpters and architects. I also have some of those genomes.</p>
                                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="scrollLink scroller bottom" name="400"></a>

                                    <div class="cube s1x2">
                                        <p>My direct artistic link is my father who was an amateur Art painter. My own artistic interest started with simple drawing to relax me.</p>
                                        <p>Combining both these passions turned me into that what I am today. The crosspoint of technology and design, UX design. In my life I am curious, ambitious and driven to reach my personal goals. My own Passion became part my work.</p>

                                        <p>My employers and projects have always reflected my personal interests. I try to find work where I can give myself the full 100% and beyond. To fit me best the project either has to do something with technological innovation, some elements of design and maybe even a touch of science. I try to stride towards those goals and create new ideas and innovations as I go along.</p>

                                        <p>Allthough I'm relatively young I do have a decent history behind me. It might surprise some but it took me 7 years in total to get an IT bachelor. This is not something I should be proud of... but it is not negative! During my time in College I kinda got bored with it all, I needed a challange!</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <img class="cube s1x1" src="resources/images/blocks/experience-intro.jpg" alt="Blegh!" title="Blegh!" />

                                        <p>That challenge I found in Joost Technologies. They re-sparked my interest and educated me way beyond what college could ever do. After 2 years I found myself in a situation that lead me back to college earning me my bachelor degree. In the mean time working in IT as I had been doing from even before Joost Technologies.</p>
                                        <p>The bachelor was not really the end, I wanted to work on a Masters degree. I have tried media technology at the Leiden university. By the program did not pose enough of a challenge and did not inspire me enough. I have not found another inpiring one yet.</p>

                                        <p>My education is not really what defined me as it comes to experience. I've gained more technological knowledge and experience outside of the classrooms then inside them.</p>
                                        <p>I've worked as a freelancer since 2006 and before that did mostly free jobs for small orgenizations. I've worked on building 4 social networking applications, two of them with over 1.000.000 users. I've worked on commercial shops, advertizing systems, knowledge management databases, project management tools and many other interesting applications with web technology. I have worked for 5 different employers all with only positive remarks.</p>

                                        <p>Next to a relatively large set of programming languages, libraries and frameworks I have also mastered the theoretical IT principle and implemented them. In that set of experience lies experience that deals with technology but also with design. I have done UX research and have worked on special needs websites.</p>
                                        <p>I can say with confidence: <em>I'm ready for anything!</em></p>

                                        <p>It not interest everyone... but I do have a small life outside of my job. Even though technology and art are both a part of my personality it doesn't mean I do not like anything else.</p>
                                        <p>I like listening to music, play a bit of snooker, do some online gaming and have a racquetball workout. All these things relax me, keep me focussed and entertained. Ever want to play a snooker match? Do come prepaired!</p>
                                        <p>In the past I did a lot of gaming. Today that is helping me solve problems faster than normal and it sparked my first interest in computers. Difital painting also came from this early love for games. I started painting mods for cars in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_2" title="Grand Prix 2 game by Microprose">GP2</a> and grew into a digital painter.</p>

                                        <p>First creating game related art and later create own creative work. It still relaxes me and give me great satisfaction.</p>

                                        <p>I like new ideas, new views and alternatives solutions to existing problems. I have always had a soft spot for the interesting new ideas and ventures.</p>
                                        <p>Personally I have created some new ideas and concepts. I have worked in a new type of content management system. Another project I worked on was a <em>location based social network</em>. Maybe the best example is something completely different, I designed a <em>conceptual shoe</em> for a sneeker company.</p>
                                        <p>I have a background in science but never really got to the point of choosing my specific field. I am always interested in new thing! I read a lot of feeds and get inspiration for all sorts of new things.</p>

                                        <p>Together with some fellow students I got contacted to set up a video conferencing system. This system was to be used to bring the experts from the museum into the classrooms of grade-schools accross the country.</p>
                                        <p>This project would not just bring the people to students who would normally get a change to talk to them. It also provides a great look behind the scenes of the museaum. Bringing the students into the archive and into the disection chambers would not have been possible in any other way!</p>

The magazine was run by a small team that produced online and printed content. The technical part of the website was done by one person when I arrived, I was hired to support him.</p>

I moved the office maintenence to a service company, moved the website and migrated the website from ASP to PHP. Even though it was an internship spot for 5 months it felt like a full-time job. I had the highest grade possible on that specific internship.</p>

                                        <p>Gaming has always been a part of my life. It was the first thing I did on a computer! Some people may say that gaming is negative but I've done a lot of stuff beyond just playing games. Gaming for me is not only playing the game, it's also organising, contributing, creating and communicating.</p>

                                        <p>I never like playing games on my own, I have always been more of a social gamer. I quickly became involved with gaming communities like the <a href="http://www.desertrabbits.com">Desert Rabbits</a> and the <a href="http://www.dutchclan.com/">Dutchclan</a>. In these communities I've organised games and I've created websites and application to accommodate the community. As contributions I have worked on graphics for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_2" title="Grand Prix 2 game by Microprose">GP2</a> and I did some minor work on <a href="http://www.openttd.org/en/">OpenTTD</a>. In gaming I try to do thing outside as well as inside the game, I like to show creativity.</p>
                                        <p>I have an extensive game collection you can see on <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/users/yopefonic/games_table?mode=own">my Gamespot.com account</a>.</p>

It allows me to focus and forget about the daily stresses of life. Don't see me as a snooker legend, the British snooker circuit would be way too tough for me. A break of 40 is good enough!</p>

                                        <p>Snooker is not really a family thing although my talent for the sport does come from my family. My dad's side of the family plays <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carom_billiards">Carom billiards</a>, this is a form of the same family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sports">Cue sports</a>. As in may things I like a challenge and tactics, snooker provides me with both as well as a social night out!</p>
                                        <p>Currently I'm playing in the Dutch team competition team called <a href="http://www.jumbo-snooker.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=63&Itemid=62">Jumbo 69</a>. I play at the <a href="http://www.jumbo-snooker.nl/">Jumbo Snooker Centre</a>. You may have recognise the websites icon to be the same as this page. That is because the websites template is one that I created for them.</p>

                                        <p>What makes this a valuable hobby? Well I keep myself up to date on a lot of news. That means that I have a good idea what is going on and where we stand in technology. I'm always in for something new and I like to work on and with the latest technologies. Another thing that new technology brings me is new ideas? new technology always induces new concepts and I'm always looking for them.</p>

The only sport that has kept me interested the last few years. I've done sports like Judo and Jujutsu but they never really stuck with me. Squash supplies me with a dose of active action, mathematics and tactics. It is also a great way for me to keep in shape, at least for a bit.</p>
                                        <p>Physical sports are regularly not my thing. But I do sometimes act as if I like the exercise. Other physical sports I did or very sporadically still do are skiing, snowboarding, kite-surfing, street-hokey, swimming and sometimes even a small match of football (I'm European so I think you can figure out which one I'm talking about).</p>

                                        <p>For me that is HTML, XML, JavaScript, RSS, atom and every other type of mark-up standard that is used on the web today. I have a lot of knowledge (but not all) about browser compatebillity and web standards. I also have in depth knowledge about the workings of CSS. I also mastered the new standards HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
                                        <p>Maybe something to look at? this page is html5 and css3 all custom made. I used JavaScript with the jQuery library to enhance the interaction. Just on of the many examples of my work in front-en development. Please note that I do not support IE6 anymore unless required.</p>

                                        <p>If you want to design anything you will need tools. Very simple tools like a pen and paper, but also more complicated tool like modellers and drawing applications.</p>
                                        <p>For graphic design I mostly use the Creative Suite by Adobe. I have worked with open-source packages like <a href="http://www.paint.net/">paint.NET</a> and <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>. I do prefer the products by adobe though...</p>
                                        <p>Creating mockups and concepts is something I do on a regular basis so I use some tools to help me. I use <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> for advanced mockups that I first created on paper. On a more advanced level I use MS Visio and <a href="http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/">DBDesigner</a> for database design.</p>

This is used as an internal tool to plan matches and hand out tactics. It is written with the help of MS Visual Studio and I co-develop on that project. Other things I have done for the desktop are a couple of games in Java and Flex. I also created a couple of tiny games in the Java library processing (can be used on web and desktop).</p>

                                        <p>I might not be a monkey in a suit but I do know something about managing an IT project! I've done low level team management for a couple of projects and I have a bachelor in IT that includes all basics in project management. I extended that with more in depth knowledge about development management methods.</p>

                                        <p>I'm schooled in the more classical management styles like PRINCE 2 and ITIL but my personally preferred management methods are more likely to be found in the agile corner of the spectrum. I prefer a more loose type of project as in most software development processes you can never completely predict the path of a project.</p>
                                        <p>I have managed projects with extreme programming, Scrum, PRINCE 2 and smaller projects with Waterfall and Cowboy. I understand most of the benefits and the pitfalls of these methods and I can help determine what method to use.</p>

At a fairly early stage when I started programming I discovered my own version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">Model View Controller design pattern</a>.</p>
                                        <p>During the classes I found a lot of patterns I already was familiar with. What the class did do was enable me to work on some of my own ideas. Writing the book instead of reading it.</p>

                                        <p>Hacking has such a bad reputation. That while the definition of the verb 'to hack' in technology means: <em>'the re-configuring or re-programming of a system to function in ways not facilitated by the owner, administrator, or designer'</em>. This is a lot softer definition than the common security thief.</p>

                                        <p>Hacking for me is more of a method I use to invent new things. I use libraries and API's and try to hack together something that was not intended by the creators. This way I find new applications to build and in the process can help to develop the API or library itself.</p>
                                        <p>I'm also somewhat of a security hacker, so I do fit the cliché a little bit. I do some work in security consulting but this is not my core business. I do provide security consults and of course I take my experience with me to every project.</p>

                                        <p>For the people who do not know what usabillity is. It is the science behind the interaction between object and user. To be more specific, it is the science behind how that user experiences that object. Maybe a bit to conceptual, but in short I can help improve efficiency and user experience of your software.</p>

                                        <p>Usabillity is a bit part of my speciality. I have studied different fassets of human computer interaction design as a science. I am well read on the theoretics but I have also done UX research on users of a higher age group. The research was to get a deeper understanding how elderly users would preceive information on a website and how we could improve designs of several websites to accomodate the elderly.</p>
                                        <p>What I can bring to clients is knowledge about interaction design for web and knowledge about the cognitive processes that allow us to use those interfaces.</p>

I started out but re-programming a <em>content management system</em> from <em>ASP</em> to <em>PHP</em>. This got me interested in doing more back-end work.

                                        <p>If we are talking about languages. You've ready I've done some stuff with ASP and PHP but I also do other languages. I have done small projects with <em>ColdFusion</em>, <em>Perl</em> and <em>Python</em>. I have been working on several larger projects in <em>Ruby on Rails</em>. This also sparked other smaller projects in Rails. I'm a fast learner so anything goes!</p>

                                        <p>SciSea is an experimental UI prototype for a scientific search engine. The project was initiated by a university project that was looking at scientific search engines like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="http://www.scirus.com/">Scirus</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The project was coded in a few days but a lot of reasearch went before it. We created paper protoypes of the search engine and its options, we made trial versions of the design and we did literature research on search engines.</p>
                                        <p>Currently the code can be found at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sciencesearch/">project page</a> on Google code. The code is freely available and is licenced under the GNU General Public License v3 licence.</p>

It has always been kind of a lost child in web programming. Therefore it is one of the most neglected areas in any web development process.

Developed in 1995 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a> it is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. Hated by many and loved by some it is one of the mostly used language on the web today. If HTML is the data and CSS is the styling than JavaScript is the interaction. Personally I use native JavaScript mixed libraries like JQuery and DojoToolkit.</p>

                                        <p>The tag editor did have some issues at that time and it was not exactly doing what we wanted. Solution? Contribute to the project, so I did!</p>
                                        <p>I implemented a giant list of features. New options, a lot of issues solved and a new version of the plugin was born. I even got the origional contributer to do some compiling work to improve the packaging of the plugin.</p>

                                        <p>PHP was my first love as a web developer. One of the first things I did was translate an ASP website into a PHP. This website was <a href="http://www.pauze.nl/">pauze.nl</a>.</p>
                                        <p>This sparked me to create my own content management system. I have used this system for a couple of my clients that are still happely using it. I am very aware of what PHP is usefull for. It is a great quick development tool, simple, slick but a bit crude at some points.</p>
                                        <p>As many first loves it will not always be THE one. Last few years I have been doing less with PHP then I should have. I have coded for 3 years with the language. This experience is mainly with PHP4.4 and PHP5.1</p>

Well, it's fast in development and allows for a very agile approach. It has a very nice community behind it and has a nice test-based development culture.

I've done work outside of Rails with just Ruby and I found myself drawn into the language more than any other language at that time. Both the framework and language have been working well for many different projects.</p>
                                        <p>I use Rails mainly for most my standard websites and I'm experienced with gem building. Authentication, asynq websites, inline-editing, searching and many other common web-paradigms I have build with up to the latest version of the framework.</p>

Where jQuery is good at plugin and widgets, Dojo is a framework that allows you to create desktop and mobile ready web applications in JavaScript.</p>

                                        <p>I did several bigger and smaller projects where I used Dojo as a JavaScript framework. The personal project <a href="http://www.d-its.net/projects/snookerscoreboard/about.html">Snooker ScoreBoard</a> is build using Dojo for Object building and event binding. Other projects the ready made widgets and UI made it very easy to build mobile ready applications fast.</p>
                                        <p>In my experience Dojo is a good alternative to any other framework if you want to build JavaScript based applications. For me it is one of the frameworks I use in those special occasions.</p>

                                        <p>GeoTweets has been an experiment to combine twitter and maps. Normally one would have twitter messages shown on a map that are from that location. We turned that around, we wanted to know what people were saying about a location. With this idea we started out working on GeoTweets.</p>

                                        <p>GeoTweets has been a project by Peter Curet, Veneta Andersen and myself worked on the concept. Graphics and research were mostly done by Veneta. Peter and I took the application under our wing.</p>
                                        <p>The code can be found on the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mmstwitterandmaps/">Google code project page</a>. It is based on Ruby with rails 2.3.5 and some gems to do json and other stuff. Using the Google maps API a click is captured and a location is derived from that. From the location a search query is send to Twitter retreiving the location records.</p>

                                        <p>Ever had one of those feelings where you would see an application somewhere and you think to yourself. I can do that better!</p>
                                        <p>The Snooker ScoreBoard is one of those projects. I found a touch application to keep score in a game of snooker at my local snooker club. Only problem... it was a commercial overweight system that cost the club way too much money. Solution, create a web-application to do it in a light weight way.</p>
                                        <p>Goal for me was to create an easy to use, web-based and free to use scoreboard application for phone and tablet use. Currently it is under development based on the HTML5 boilerplate and Dojo Toolkit.</p>
